        After going to University of South Florida studying architecture
        and finding out it would take me 7 years to graduate, I decided
        to make a change. I left college and decided to take a different
        path, so in March of 2022, I joined Project Innovate Newark, a 
        non-profit organization based out of Newark, New Jersey. With no
        prior software engineering experience, I've taken a different 
        approach of learning through mentorship and workshops. I primarily
        started as a CSX Curriculum Developer by creating a UI/UX Submodule 
        using several free browser programs such as Figma, JSFiddle, and GitHub; and 
        coding in HTML and CSS. In June of 2022, I began to advance as a Software
        Engineer and worked on our public-facing and admin
        applications. I've been able to make functional changes that 
        advance the consumer's experience using Javascript, React, and CSS.
        Lastly, in October of 2022, I started servicing in the People department,
        which consisted of curating content for the interview
        process for new potential candidates, marketing documentation for
        job fairs, and being apart of the interview process for the first 
        round. I'm excited to see where this opportunity will take me in the future.
