          Hi! My name is Shane Palmeri and I reside in the Tampa Bay Area.
          I am currently a Software Engineer and UX Designer. I've taken a non-traditional
          approach in learning computer science through Project Innovate Newark, with a
          focus on career development and learning through a mentorship style experience.
          Project Innovate Newark has given me the opportunity to make an impact as a Software
          Engineer, People Manager, and the CSX Curriculum Developer. The skills I have accomplished
          will undoubtedly support long-lasting impacts on my current and professional endeavors.
          For as long as I can remember, creativity has driven me to create an outlet for myself
          and have always wanted to work in a field where creativity and design is a priority.
